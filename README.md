# Getting started

To build your own app on top of the Starter Kit, fork or mirror this repository. Because you can't rename a fork, for serious use we recommend [mirroring using these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/). To contribute to Starter Kit development or just playing around, forking is the way to go.

Once you have the code downloaded, follow the **[Setup guide](docs/SETUP.md)** to get started.

# Architecture

The application architecture is based on [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) and [redux-loop](https://github.com/raisemarketplace/redux-loop).

Read the **[Architecture guide](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** for more details.
